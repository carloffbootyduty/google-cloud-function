To start a new project in the Google Cloud, we can go to the 
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) or create it from the 
[Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

##Creating a virtual environment
We run this command to activate a virtual environment
```
venv\scripts\activate.bat
```
In Order to add new packages to the virtual environment the file `requirements` has to be created
and the following command needs to be executed
```

```
Go to Settings STRG + ALT + S and add the new virtual environment to the project
